# A lecture

A lecturekit project: one `slides.qmd`, a live deck and a study PDF.

```bash
lk build            # both outputs into _build/, timing plan on the terminal
lk build --to live  # the live deck only
lk build --profile dark
lk review shoot _build/slides-live.html
lk review measure _build/slides-live.html
lk clips            # anim/clip_*.py on the Manim kit, into assets/clips
```

Method: `STORYBOARD.md` (intent) → `PLAN.md` (slides and minutes) →
`sims/` (what the figures show) → `make_assets.py` (figures from numbers) →
`slides.qmd` → review rounds → `FACTS.md` and `MANIFEST.md` → this file as the log.
