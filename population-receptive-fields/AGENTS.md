# Working on this project

This is a lecturekit project. Read the engine's rules first: `lk docs` lists
them (`AUTHORING.md` for the dialect, `LAYOUT.md` for the pixel budget,
`WORKFLOW.md` for the method, `POLICY.md` for what goes on a slide).

Commands: `lk build`, `lk review shoot|measure|frags|contrast|overflow|figs`,
`lk clips`, `lk theme`.

Rules that are this project's own:

- Budget: `budget:` in the front matter of `slides.qmd`; every slide heading carries `time=`.
- Colours: `_brand.yml`; never a hex value in a figure or a clip.
- Every number on a slide traces to `assets/data/` and `FACTS.md`.
- A figure whose data are missing becomes a labelled placeholder; the deck always builds.
- The lecturer decides claims, titles and what the lecture is for. Do not change them silently.
